Wallet Tracker: 

Wallet Tracker is a simple web app that lets users check their crypto wallet balances, view historical transactions, and export transaction histories to CSV. 
Built with Next.js, v0.dev, and shadcn/ui, it connects to Tatum, Etherscan, and CoinGecko APIs to pull accurate blockchain and market data securely. No wallet connection needed. 

Features: 

Transaction history: view all incoming and outgoing transactions per wallet address.
CSV export: download transaction data for accounting, reporting, or tax purposes.
Real-time USD values: integrates Etherscan and CoinGecko to display live pricing.
Clean, responsive UI: optimized for speed and readability. 
Secure: reads only public blockchain data; no wallet connection or private keys.
